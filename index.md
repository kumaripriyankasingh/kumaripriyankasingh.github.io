# About Me
I am a Senior Backend Engineer at Uber with over 11 years of experience in designing and building software systems. Currently based in Washington, United States, I have a strong background in developing various types of software systems, ranging from low latency and highly available distributed systems to microservices for mobile and desktop platforms.

Prior to my current role, I worked at Amazon, Ola, Paypal and Samsung.

I hold a B.Tech (Hons.) degree in Computer Science & Engineering from the prestigious National Institute of Technology Jamshedpur. Throughout my academic journey, I consistently ranked first in my department as well as in high school.

Beyond my professional achievements, I have a passion for personal growth and enjoyment. In my free time, I indulge in reading, dancing, and listening to music.
