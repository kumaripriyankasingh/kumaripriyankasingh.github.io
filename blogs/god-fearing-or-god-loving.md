# God Fearing or God Loving?

![](../assets/images/god-fearing-or-god-loving.webp)

India is currently wrapped in the colors, sounds, and vibrant energy of festival season. As streets fill with people participating in various rituals and ceremonies, there’s a clear display of devotion and an aim to please God. However, as I observe these practices unfold, I can’t help but ponder: Is this the only way to connect with the divine?

Many believe that if they don’t take part in these rituals, they might anger the gods. This notion has become so ingrained that it dictates how people act during these festive times. Yet, when I turn my gaze towards the world at large, I notice a different pattern. Countries that prioritize empathy, kindness, and putting others first are the ones that seem to truly prosper. It appears as though the divine smiles more favorably upon those who uphold human values above all else.

Now, don’t get me wrong. I’m not advocating against rituals or religious practices. We live in a diverse world, and everyone should have the freedom to express their beliefs in the way they see fit. However, my concern arises when these practices overshadow our basic duties and responsibilities towards one another.

I believe that what truly matters to the divine is not the hours we spend in worship, but the love and kindness we extend to each other. Serving humanity and being dutiful in our actions is perhaps the truest form of devotion.

India, with its incredible potential, stands on the brink of greatness. To cross over, we need individuals who are professionals in every sense of the word. Being a professional means remaining committed to your responsibilities, even in the face of challenges and dilemmas.

Instead of fearing God, let us learn to love and cherish the divine. God seeks our honesty and our commitment to making the world a better place, not our blind devotion.

Consider a student in the midst of exams during the festival season. It’s absolutely okay for them to focus on their studies instead of engaging in rituals. After all, performing their duty as a student is their form of worship at that moment.

Similarly, adults with responsibilities should prioritize helping others over ritualistic practices. The actions we take to support and uplift one another are the most powerful form of devotion.

In conclusion, this festival season, let’s strive to put humanity at the forefront of our celebrations. Let’s remember that kindness, duty, and integrity are the highest forms of devotion. By doing so, we honor the divine, contribute to our nation’s prosperity, and most importantly, uphold the essence of humanity.
