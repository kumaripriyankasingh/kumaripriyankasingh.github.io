# When Success Feels Like Selfishness

“High achievers are mostly selfish.”
A friend said this to me recently, and it didn't just sting—it landed like a stone in a quiet pond, creating ripples of doubt that I haven't been able to settle. At first, I wanted to defend myself. I wanted to list my responsibilities, my exhaustion, and my "reasons." But as the silence stretched between us, I realized he was mostly right.
Lately, he’s been asking me to grab coffee to discuss a startup idea. Every time, I give him the same script: I’m buried at the office. I’m managing the house. I’m just... tired. By the time I finish juggling the demands of my career and the logistics of my life, my brain feels like a spent battery. I don't want to think about the "uncertainty" of a startup when I have a job that pays the bills on time. In a world that screams at us to "hustle 24/7" and have three side-gigs, my exhaustion might look like laziness. But it isn't laziness. It’s a survival instinct.
But then, I think about what my friend really meant. He wasn't attacking my work ethic; he was mourning my absence.

### **The Cost of Stability**

We give up so much to reach "stability." Recently, my parents were in an accident. My mother suffered serious injuries to her leg. In the weeks that followed, I made sure the medical bills were paid. But I never sat by her side. I never helped with the dressings. I wasn't the one holding her hand through the pain.
While I was busy being "successful at work," other family members were doing the quiet, messy work of caregiving. And that’s the hardest truth to swallow: Care heals more than medicine ever will.
When I fall sick, the first thing I want isn't a prescription—it’s my mother. Her presence is the only thing that makes me feel safe. Yet, when the roles were reversed, I let my fear of "performance degradation" at work keep me at my desk. I was so worried that my output would slip if I took a breath that I traded the moments that actually matter for a few more hours of productivity.

### **The "Duty" vs. "Selfishness" Paradox**

To the outside world, the high achiever looks selfish. They skip the birthday dinner to finish a project; they are "on their phone" during vacation; they prioritize their personal goals over group harmony.
However, from the inside, the high achiever often feels a heavy sense of duty. They feel that if they stop, the "engine" stops. They believe they are carrying the weight of the company, the family, or the future on their shoulders. This creates a tragic disconnect: the achiever feels like a martyr, while the people around them feel neglected.
I’ve learned a hard lesson lately: No matter how much money you spend to solve a problem, it can never replace your physical presence. A bank transfer isn't a conversation. A paid bill isn't a hug.

### **Finding the Middle Ground**

So, where does that leave us?
I don’t think the answer is to stop achieving or to abandon our ambitions. But I do think we have to make peace with the fact that any extreme is a form of self-destruction.
Balance isn't just a corporate buzzword; it’s a spiritual necessity. It’s about realizing that "selfishness" often comes from a place of fear—the fear of not being enough, or the fear of losing what we’ve built.
Moving forward, I’m trying to learn that being "high-achieving" should include achieving a sense of presence.

I want to be the person who pays her bills, yes—but I also want to be the person who sits by the bed.

Because at the end of the day, what good is a "stable" life if you’re too busy building it to actually live in it?
