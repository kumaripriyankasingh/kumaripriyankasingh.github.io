# Relationship Advice from Shiva and Parvati

I was listening to this podcast the other day that honestly should be required listening for everyone in their 20s. Right up there with learning how taxes actually work and realizing that telling yourself "I'll do it tomorrow" is the biggest lie of adulthood.

If you missed it, don't worry. I’m here to give you the cliff notes because, let’s be real, being in your 20s is a weird, beautiful paradox. It’s arguably the most defining phase of your life, yet most of us treat it like a "free trial" version of adulthood. We’re all out here grinding, trying to build a career empire before we're thirty, while still occasionally eating cereal for dinner because washing a pot feels like a "future me" problem.

But while we are obsessing over LinkedIn updates and hustle culture, there is a much quieter, much bigger decision happening in the background that's going to define your happiness way more than your job title: **Who are you going to walk through life with?**

### **The "Solo vs. Sorry" Reality Check**

Here’s the cold truth that society tries to hide with wedding hashtags: **Choosing the wrong partner is the most expensive mistake you will ever make.** And I don't just mean financially. I mean mentally and emotionally expensive.

There is a massive difference between being "alone" and being lonely because you're with the wrong person. I would take being single and peaceful over being coupled up and anxious any day of the week.

Life is a marathon. It’s long, and it’s tiring. A good partner makes the incline feel like a breeze. A bad partner is like running that marathon with a backpack full of rocks that they keep adding to. Marriage, as an institution, was largely created for legalities and inheritance; a **partnership** is about your soul's sanity.


### **The Bollywood Lie: One-Sided Poison**

Before we find the right person, we have to unlearn the trash we've been fed. We’ve been raised on a diet of movies that try to convince us that "unconditional love" means chasing someone who clearly doesn't want to be caught.

Let’s be blunt: **One-sided love isn't a beautiful tragedy; it’s slow-acting poison.** It kills your self-esteem while you’re busy trying to be the hero of the story. You cannot "love" someone into fixing themselves, and your affection isn't a currency that entitles you to theirs. You aren't a rehab center for emotionally unavailable people. If you’re in a dynamic where you’re doing all the heavy lifting, stop trying to be the main character in a movie that isn't even being filmed. Seriously, just run. Your 20s are too short to spend them on a "maybe."

### **The Divine Blueprint (Shiva & Parvati)**

Okay, so if modern dating is a dumpster fire, where do we look for advice? I like to look at the ultimate power couple: **Lord Shiva and Maa Parvati.** Forget just being "spouses"—they are the blueprint for what an actual connection looks like once the initial honeymoon fog burns off. In their stories, they laid out exactly what matters when you strip away the superficial stuff.


#### **If you're looking for a man, look for the 3 Ps:**



* **The Protector:** Get the image of a caveman fighting a bear out of your head. I’m talking about someone who protects your **peace and your dignity**. Does he have your back when you aren't in the room? If his friends are roasting you and he’s just laughing along to be "one of the guys," he’s not protecting you. He should be the wall between you and the nonsense of the world, not the one opening the gate for it.
* **The Provider:** Yes, finances matter, but that’s the baseline. The real flex here is providing **emotional safety**. Are you constantly starving for his attention? Do you have to beg for bare-minimum consistency, like a text back or following through on a plan? A provider makes sure your emotional cup is full without you having to shake it in his face.
* **The Pamperer:** This isn't just about buying expensive gifts. It’s about making you feel **cherished**. Does he know your coffee order? Does he still try to impress you even though he already "has" you? If making you feel special feels like a burdensome chore to him, he’s not the one.


#### **If you're looking for a woman, look for these pillars:**



* **The Nurturing Friend (The Safe Harbor):** The world expects men to be tough 24/7. It’s exhausting. You need a woman who can be your soft place to land—offering that comfort where you don't have to perform strength. But she also needs to be your "homie." Someone you can sit on the couch with, talk absolute nonsense, and be your weird, unfiltered self without feeling judged.
* **The Deep Acceptance (The "No Disgust" Factor):** This is the deepest one. Think about the unconditional way a mother loves her child—she deals with their literal messes without batting an eye because the love is bigger than the mess. A real partner sees your "muck"—your failures, your gross habits, your bad days—and doesn't recoil. If she looks at your vulnerabilities with disgust or embarrassment, you can never truly be safe.
* **The Eternal Spark:** Relationships get boring if you let them. You don't want to end up as just highly efficient roommates who pay bills together. You need a partner who brings a certain "spice," a playfulness, and a willingness to keep the romance fresh even when life gets routine.

### **The Final Takeaway**

Look, when we first crush on someone, our brains are amazing at ignoring red flags. We see a giant neon warning sign and think, *"Ooh, what a pretty shade of crimson!"* But the mask always slips eventually.

Finding the right person isn't about finding someone perfect. It’s just about using your head a little bit *before* you completely give away your heart. If you look for these foundational pieces early on, you won’t just find a husband or wife—you’ll find a sanctuary.

And honestly? That’s worth way more than any promotion. Choose wisely.
